## 0.6.0
### Added
- The `new` command receives a `NAME` parameter that will be converted to the unreleased file name
- Tests to verify if changes subcategories are properly tabulated on markdown file
- Tests to verify if `release` command is properly aborted if no `codelog.yml` file is found
- Interactive creation of the change files

### Fixed
- When an unreleased file is not parseable to yml, the user will get a friendly message, saying both file and line that are wrong.
